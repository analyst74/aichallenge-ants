Random sparkles:
task/ant prioritization
    - one way is to group ant into priority groups (i.e. individual combat groups, all explorers, all food gatherers etc) with same priority setting for similar task, then override particular groups/ants as the planner sees fit. Then resolve movement of each group from top priority to lowest, there could possibly be some in-group priority for each ant as well, for certain group, like combat groups
        - simplest move is go from ant to ant (top to bottom priority)
            downside is that it doesn't address coordinated move, like for ant A,B,C next to each other, A moving to B's position, B to C's position and C somewhere else
        - or to establish a desired formation for each group and permutate the group formation to find one that's closest to the desired formation
            downside is that it is computation intensive, unless an efficient algorithm is discovered
            also, when it's not possible to achieve desired formation in one turn, it's difficult to decide what's the best formation for next turn
        - or when moving one ant, it *pushes* other unmoved ant(lower priority) around to make way to its target
            potentially unwanted outcome
