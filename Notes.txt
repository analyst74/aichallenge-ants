Architecture:
- each ant has a flag marking it as free/moved
- main game loop start with various tasks, ordered by precedence, and move appropriate ant to achieve those objectives. this process repeats until all tasks are completed
    - order of importance: protect home, gather, raze, combat, explore

Tasks
- protect home
- gather food
    keep track of known food, loop through all of them and find nearest ant (ignore enemy ant for now), stopping at a max radius (i.e. 5)
- combat
    active on all ants who have enemy in range x (heuristic, can start with attack radius + 2)
    calculate current threat state, by calculating enemy ants / friendly ants within range x
    if outnumbered (threat level > 1), run toward friendly, by calculating threat state of each valid direction (lowest)
        potential improvement, instead of check next step, check n steps (heuristic)
    if outnumber enemy (threat level < 1), run toward enemy, by threat state of each valid direction (highest)
- raze
    similar logic as gather food, except enemy hill location is remembered until razed, and a greater number of ants will be called for
- explore
    establish beaten path value, every time a block is being stepped on, its beaten path value increases by x (heuristic)
    ant in explore mode will choose path with smallest x, aka least traveled route
    beaten path value is reduced 
    
Combat:
combat logic is only applied to tasks noted with (combat-aware), in those situations, individual ants will assess strength ratio, if it is out numbered, it will retreat to opposite direction
    
Fail-safe check:
- make sure ants do not go into the same spot, killing each other by updating map info as soon one ant makes a move (in issue_order function)
