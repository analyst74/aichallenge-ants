combat - for each group, try to move them all in the same direction, through a voting system
    bad idea, only works better in certain edge scenarios, worse in some edge scenarios, and same in most
combat - establish a move-table, with priority and secondary preferred locatoin so higher priority ants will move to wherever they want, and lower priority ants will move to highest desirable place that's not occupied yet
        - better idea: only do this when regrouping, as formation improvement on attacking is only possible in edge cases
        - better idea part 2: use formation permutation to find the optimal formation
combat - do a 1 step look ahead, for following situations: 
    my group: press forward, or regroup behind attackradius+1
    enemy group: press forward, stay put (we can't anticipate how enemy will regroup, and it is the same as stay put for practical purpose)

1, try/resarch on if we can do gaussian blur with mask array
    no
2, check if ndimage distance can be used to do distancing in combat (or other more efficient distance checking)
    no
3, see if converting neighbour_table to numpy array, and pass it to cython function for lookup purpose will do any good
    we actually do not want too many levels of diffuse call per turn, so this is good enough

Idea to Revamp the influence map:
1, change it re-generate every turn, so no history is kept
	1a, this allows not setting influence on my own ant
	1b, alternatively, we can set huge negative influence on desirables to cloud over my ant's influence, without worrying about lingering effect
2, only blur from desirabilities
3, keep track of visible, explored but not visible and un-explored space, giving them appropriate influence level

ALL of the ideas above generated undesirable side effect, no go

I've got an idea, record the direction of each spot, and in the past n turns (say 10), where did other ants from this spot moved toward? If the majority past thresh hold x (say 50%), then we will just move toward the same direction.
This will likely cause 2 effects:
1, when starting out from a tight maze, ants will not be stuck close to ant hills bouncing around because the "observer effect" caused by other ants
2, this will cause higher chance of flocking in denser  situation, hopefully driving more ants to go toward heavy combat zones

Why haven't I thought of starting a journal to organize my thinking bits better? This would be way easier to navigate than random bits in that Notes.txt!

Right now, there are a few problem the AI faces:
1, not expanding fast enough, most visible in maze maps, but also slightly inefficient on open maps
2, not aggressive enough to take hills, partly related to the above, but can be solved differently
3, not protecting my own hill when there is limited resources, can be solved by solving #1, or differently
4, ant movement is not prioritized, i.e. when retreating, we want to make sure the ant in front line can retreat

basically, if we solve #1, we'd have huge improvements!
