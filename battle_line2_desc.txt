set up combat groups, then for each group
    get distance influence map for enemy (up to distance < 27, which is about 3 steps outside attack radius)
    get danger zone (within attack radius of all squares reachable by enemy ants next turn) 
        this can be derived from distance influence map
        
    iterate all moves within kill zone 
        calculate distance influence after move (up to distance < 11, aka danger zone)
        do combat evaluation (how many enemies are in danger zone, and how many of our ants are in kill zone)
        if result is good (enemy < us), execute the move and move onto next combat group
        else (enemy >= us), move on to next move combination
            
    if no good move combination is found
        iterate all moves outside kill zone, but inside danger zone
            do combat evaluation (how many enemies are in attack zone, and how many of our ants are in danger zone)
            if result is good (enemy <= us), execute the move and move onto next combat group
            else (enemy > us), move on to next move combination
    
    if we still haven't found a good move combo yet, we're totally out numbered
    move all ants toward outside danger zone
        if no such move is possible, we're backed up to wall, just go to higher distance, and hope we can escape
        
        it's also possible that we're surrounded...hmmm
