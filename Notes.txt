Architecture:
- each ant has a flag marking it as free/moved
- main game loop start with various tasks, ordered by precedence, and move appropriate ant to achieve those objectives. this process repeats until all tasks are completed
    - order of importance: protect home, gather, raze, combat, explore

Tasks
- protect home
- gather food
    keep track of known food, loop through all of them and find nearest ant (ignore enemy ant for now), stopping at a max radius (i.e. 5)
- raze (combat-aware)
- explore (combat-aware)
    establish a center of empire (based on ant locations), and move away from it
    
Combat:
combat logic is only applied to tasks noted with (combat-aware), in those situations, individual ants will assess strength ratio, if it is out numbered, it will retreat to opposite direction
    
Fail-safe check:
- make sure ants do not go into the same spot, killing each other
    1, update ant position as soon one ant makes a move
    2, keep a list of previous move target positions, and do not move into those
