Why haven't I thought of starting a journal to organize my thinking bits better? This would be way easier to navigate than random bits in that Notes.txt!

Right now, there are a few problem the AI faces:
1, not expanding fast enough, most visible in maze maps, but also slightly inefficient on open maps
2, not aggressive enough to take hills, partly related to the above, but can be solved differently
3, not protecting my own hill when there is limited resources, can be solved by solving #1, or differently

basically, if we solve #1, we'd have huge improvements!
